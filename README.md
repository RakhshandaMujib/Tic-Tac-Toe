# Tic-Tac-Toe
I'm in the middle of an online Python course and this is my first attempt at creating a Python project- the game of Tic Tac Toe. The code needs a lot of improvement, I know but as a novice programmer this is all I could do as a first attempt. Throw in your ideas, I'd love to see and learn from them! Thanks, already.
